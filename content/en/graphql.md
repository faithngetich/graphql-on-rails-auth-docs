## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a data query language and specification developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly open sourced in 2015.

It provides an alternative to REST-based architectures with the purpose of increasing developer productivity and minimizing amounts of data transferred.

At it's core, GraphQL is a syntax that lets you specify what data you want to receive from an API.

Unlike SQL, GraphQL does not go into your database directly but to your GraphQL API endpoint which, in turn, can connect to a database or any other data source.

GraphQL is used in production by hundreds of organizations of all sizes including Facebook, GitHub, PayPal, Shopify, the New York Times and many more.


## Why GraphQL?

GraphQL has been a game changer for me and these have been big wins for me over RESTful architectures. I'll pick GraphQL anytime

1. Simpler cross-platform and mobile development
2. Ask for what you need, get exactly that
3. Get many resources/entities in a single request
4. Type checking with the GraphQL type system
5. Powerful developer tools with inbuilt code documentation
6. No more API versioning!
7. Get predictable results. No surprises
